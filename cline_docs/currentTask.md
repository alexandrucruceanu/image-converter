# Current Task: Add RAW File Input Support

## Objective
- Update all project documentation (`projectRoadmap.md`, `currentTask.md`, `techStack.md`, `codebaseSummary.md`) and the `README.md` file to reflect the current state of the application, especially the completed RAW file input support.

## Context
- RAW file input support has been successfully implemented and tested.
- The `TypeError: librawInstance.recycle is not a function` error is a minor console warning that does not affect core functionality and can be addressed in a future iteration if necessary.

## Next Steps
1.  **Update `techStack.md`**: Ensure `libraw-wasm` is correctly described as fully integrated for RAW decoding.
2.  **Update `codebaseSummary.md`**: Ensure the "RAW File Support" section under "Recent Significant Changes" is accurate and reflects the completed integration.
3.  **Update `README.md`**: Add a section about RAW file support and update the features list to reflect the current state of the application.

## Current Status
- **Completed:** RAW file input support.
- **In Progress:** Updating documentation and `README.md`.
