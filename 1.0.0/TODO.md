# TODO List for Image Converter Beta v1.0.2

## Core Functionality Improvements

### 6. Performance Optimization
- [x] Implement web workers for processing
- [x] Add image loading optimization
- [x] Implement lazy loading for previews
- [ ] Add caching system

**AI Prompt:**
```
I need to optimize the performance of my image converter app. Currently, all processing is done in the main thread:

function convertImage(file, format) {
    const reader = new FileReader();
    // ... existing synchronous processing
}

Please help me implement performance optimizations using web workers, lazy loading, and proper caching strategies.
```

### 7. Enhanced UI/UX
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Implement tooltips
- [x] Add onboarding tutorial
- [x] Improve accessibility

**AI Prompt:**
```
I need to enhance the UI/UX of my image converter app. Current implementation is basic:

<div class="controls">
    <button class="btn">Upload Image</button>
    <select id="formatSelect">...</select>
    <button class="btn">Convert</button>
</div>

Please help me implement keyboard shortcuts, tooltips, an onboarding tutorial, and improve accessibility following WCAG guidelines.
```

### 9. Advanced Format Support
- [x] Add TIFF support
- [x] Implement SVG handling
- [x] Add GIF support

**AI Prompt:**
```
I need to add support for more image formats to my converter. Currently supporting:

<select id="formatSelect" class="format-select">
    <option value="png">PNG</option>
    <option value="jpg">JPG</option>
    <option value="webp">WEBP</option>
</select>

Please help me implement support for additional formats (TIFF, SVG, GIF) with format-specific handling and options.
```

### 10. Progressive Enhancement
- [x] Add offline support
- [x] Implement PWA features
- [x] Add local storage backup
- [x] Implement state persistence

**AI Prompt:**
```
I need to add progressive enhancement features to my image converter app. Currently, it's a basic web app without offline capabilities.

Please help me implement PWA features, offline support, local storage backup, and state persistence for a better user experience.
```

## Notes
- Each task should be implemented with proper testing
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Update documentation for new features
- Consider mobile-first approach for new UI elements
